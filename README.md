# Stochastic-Optimization
Project for Stochastic Programming

All the programs are written in Optimization Programing Language "Julia".

The contents of Optimization under Uncertainty:

1. L-shaped method (Single Cut);
2. L-shaped method (Multiple Cuts);
3. Level Decomposition;
4. Partition-based Approach;
5. Monte Carlo Approach for Sample Average Approximation (SAA); (Monte Carlo SAA.ipynb)

Note: 

1. The L-shape method is the Bender's Decomposition in stochastic programing;
2. Examples are in another pdf file (Example.pdf);
3. This example has been proved to be complete recourse, which means no need on feasibility cuts;
