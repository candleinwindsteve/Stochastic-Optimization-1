# Stochastic-Optimization
Project for Stochastic Programming

All the programs are written in Optimization Programing Language "Julia".

The contents of Optimization under Uncertainty:

1. L-shaped method (Single Cut);
2. L-shaped method (Multiple Cuts);
3. Level Decomposition;
4. Partition-based Approach;
5. Monte Carlo Approach for Sample Average Approximation (SAA);

Note: The L-shape method is the Bender's Decomposition in stochastic programing;

Example:
Consider a stochastic linear program:
<center>  $$min 2x_{1}+3x_{2}+E[7y_{1}]$$ </center>


$\text{S}_1(N) = \sum_{p=1}^N \text{E}(p)$
